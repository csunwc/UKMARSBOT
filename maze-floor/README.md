My rendering of UTAD 540x540mm floor board design by Antonio Valente in 2 different versions (6mm & 7mm peg holes). 
The hole size is a parameter (in Equation feature) in SolidWorks and can be easily changed for a proper fit.
These boards can be stacked in 2 or 3 layers to create a Tongue and Groove connection.
