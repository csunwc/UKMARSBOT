My rendering of UTAD 540x540mm floor board design by Antonio Valente in 2 different versions (6mm & 7mm peg holes). 
The hole size is a parameter (in Equation feature) in SolidWorks and can be easily changed for a proper fit.
These boards can be stacked in 2 or 3 layers to create a Tongue and Groove connection.

Here is my 2-layer stacked assembly.  I laser-cut 1/4 inch (6.3 mm) MDF panels on a 100W machine.
One benefit of laser I found is that cut edge is covered with a burn layer and thus no additional sealing is needed.
I use 10mm depth, 7mm diameter plastic pegs from an old micromouse wall kit.
